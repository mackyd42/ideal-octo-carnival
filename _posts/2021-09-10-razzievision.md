Do you like terrible movies? Of course you do!

But do you know when they are on?

Razzievision is a simple app that will show you! Pick a film that has been nominated for the Worst Picture at the [Golden Raspberry Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Awards) and the app show you when you can next see it on your TV.

Alternatively the timeline view will show you when the next worst films are on and on what channel. Like we said, simple. Awful movies have never been simpler to find.
