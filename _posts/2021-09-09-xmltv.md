XMLTV provides UK TV listings in an standardised XML format for easy consumption by many apps.

[xmltv.co.uk](https://www.xmltv.co.uk) is where we put the generated TV listing files and our basic viewer that makes use of the data to provide a simple EPG that doubles as a demo as what is possible with the data.

The data is generated from authoritative sources and updated on a daily basis. There are various collections of data available - channel genre specific, one or seven day listings, and more. If you need a very simple EPG, or programmatic access to TV schedule data, it's got you covered.
