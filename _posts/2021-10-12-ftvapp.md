A simple, clean, accessible TV guide for your PC.

Streaming may be on the rise, but there's still lots of good stuff to be found on the normal channels on your TV. So while everybody has moved on to making programs for smaller devices with smaller writing that you have to squint to see, Easier does it again with a big, clean, program you can use on your PC.

With an adjustable font size, program search, and filters for Audio Description and subtitles, the FTV guide provides listings for every channel on your TV for the next seven days without any fuss.

And it's cheaper than the Radio Times. Only £8.99 a month.
