Easier is a family run software company that has been making software for many years. Whehter it's speciality software for low-vision users, or speciality software for people with very specific niches and interests, we try to cater to all budgets.

Even at this time of human history and communication, we specialise in crafting applications for PC/Desktop/Laptop as opposed to phones or tablets. While valuable, we reject the notion that the modern way is the only way and that PCs are only fit for landfill. So we make simple, straightforward apps that live up to our name, Easier. Because 'Why be difficult?'
